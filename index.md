## Data Literacy

During my masters thesis research, I developed a qualitative scale to assess the data literacy of high school students. The motivation for the construction of the scale came from the perception of the importance of creating means for the teaching and learning of data science concepts, taking into account that we live in a data-oriented society. 

You can access the scale at this link: xxxxxxxxx

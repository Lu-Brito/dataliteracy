## Towards Data Literacy

During my master's thesis research, with support from the Data Literacy Research Group at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, I developed a qualitative scale to assess the data literacy of high school students.

From extensive bibliographic research, we understood that it was necessary to provide education of initial concepts in Data Science since we live in a data-oriented society.

For more information on the research carried out for its design, access the complete thesis here.
